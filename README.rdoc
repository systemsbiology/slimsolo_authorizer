=SLIMsolo Authorizer

This plugin/engine provides:

1. Authentication based on restful_authentication (http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication)
2. Very simple authorization by role
3. Management of shared lab groups and users in the parent application's database.

It is an alternative to SLIMcore Authorizer (http://github.com/bmarzolf/slimcore_authorizer), 
which allows for single sign-on capabilities between applications via RubyCAS-server, and 
shared users and lab groups using SLIMcore (http://github.com/bmarzolf/slimcore).

Note: This was built for Rails 2.3.2 apps, so other versions may require some tinkering.

==Quickstart

Install Rails Engines, by running this in your app root:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/lazyatom/engines.git

Then add this to your config/environment.rb as directed by the Engines instructions:

  require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/plugins/engines/boot')

Install SLIMsolo Authorizer:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/bmarzolf/slimsolo_authorizer.git
  script/generate slimsolo_authorizer .
  rake db:migrate

Then add this to your app/controllers/application_controller.rb:

  include AuthenticatedSystem 
  include Authorization

Copy config/application.yml.example to application.yml, but it's not necessary to configure the 
rubycas and slimcore settings since these won't be used with slimsolo_authorizer.

Edit your application layout (typically app/views/layout/application.html.erb) to include the 
following in the <head></head> section:

  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'tinytable.css' %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'tinytable-packed' %>

Run:

  script/server

And you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:3000/users and 
http://localhost:3000/lab_groups to manage users and lab groups.

==Using Authentication and Authorization

Authenticate on your own controllers by adding:

  before_filter :login_required

Check authorization in controllers using:

  before_filter :staff_or_admin_required  # staff or admin access

or

  before_filter :admin_required  # admin-only

==User and Lab Group Interfaces

Link to the user and lab group management interfaces from your app like:

  <%= link_to 'Users', users_path %>
  <%= link_to 'Lab Groups', lab_groups_path %>

==Logout

Add the following link wherever it would be appropriate to have a link to log out:

  <%= link_to "logout", :controller => 'sessions', :action => 'destroy' %>

==User Profiles and Lab Group Profiles

In order to allow application-specific user and lab group data, SLIMsolo Authorizer adds 
two models to your application, UserProfile and LabGroupProfile. Each UserProfile and 
LabGroupProfile references a User or LabGroup, respectively.
